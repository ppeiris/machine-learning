\chapter{Evaluation Metrics}

Using Neural network classifier to make classification on Kepler TCEs is a discrete prediction machine learning problem. That is to say; the NN decide what category the given TCE belong to. There are many metrics available for us to check how well our NN is performing and I am planning to use couple of these metrics in this project, 

\begin{itemize}
  \item Accuracy Score
  \item Confusion Metrix
\item Mean Squire Error 
\end{itemize}
