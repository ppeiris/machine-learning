\chapter{Evaluation Metrics}

Using Neural network classifier to make classification on Kepler TCEs is a discrete prediction machine learning problem. That is to say; the NN decide what category the given TCE belong to. There are many metrics available for us to check how well our NN is performing and I am planning to use couple of these metrics in this project,

\emph{Mean Squire Error}, Attribute selection process will be using  Independent Component Analysis (as explain in the section \ref{label:important_attributes}) and MSE will use as the evaluation matrix for this stage.

\emph{Confusion Metrix}, will be as evaluation metrics for the NN. In confusion matrix, the columns indicate predicted classes, and rows indicates the actual classes. An entry in the diagonal shows the correct count classifications; off-diagonal indicates misclassifications of various kinds.
