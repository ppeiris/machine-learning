\chapter{Solution Statement}


Machine learning techniques contribute a way to automate some step of exoplanet discovery. The TCE vetting process is a tedious and time-consuming (mostly a manual) process. Modern astronomical observational instruments generate a large amount of data within a short period of observational time. These observations may contain such a crucial events that need future follow-up observations using other telescopes (using other wavelengths); hence, processing these time series data and extracting meaningful information is a time sensitive process. Solution to this is to process Kepler data using machine learning algorithms to express the classification while reducing human errors. I am planning to use trained Neural Network to process the TCE data to make the classification.
