\chapter{Benchmark Model}

I am planning to experiment with benchmarking the neural network by performing many training trials by varying number of training data sets. For each trail $i$, the training time to obtain a correct network $t_i$ will be recorded. Trials which are not successful within a time limit $T$ will consider as failures. Initial weight will be randomly chosen \cite{hamey1991benchmarking}.
