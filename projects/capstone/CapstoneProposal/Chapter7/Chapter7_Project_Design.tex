 \chapter{Project Design}

Theoretical workflow of the project 

\begin{itemize}
\item Download data from NASA Exoplanet archives 
\item Clean up attribute values 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Understanding correlated attributes and remove them from final attribute set
		\item Produce additional Attributes
	\end{itemize}
\item Generate data into training, testing datasets. 
\item Develop a multilayered neural network using Python programming language 
\item Train the Neural Network 
\item Compare network results with the NASA Exoplanet Data
\end{itemize}
